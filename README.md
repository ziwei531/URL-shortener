# URL shortener with EJS and MongoDB 2023 March

This is a project I've done for the purpose of refreshing my memory on how to code in the backend . As I used to learn all about the backend in MongoDB, hence, I utilized Express and EJS for this project. Below is a screenshot of the project

## Instruction
Click on the shortened URL to be redirected to the original link's website. 
Please take note that as I'm using shortid to generate the short url ID, hence, as I'm using a free hosting website thus my link, once copied, is not short at all. However, this project is done for learning purposes and hence such issue shouldn't be too significant.
